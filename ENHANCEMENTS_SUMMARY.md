### 4. Applicant vs Recruiter Registration ‚è≥
**Requirements**:
- Update auth modal to show account type selection

**Implementation Plan**:
1. Add account type selection screen in auth modal
2. Create separate registration flows
3. Update backend to support applicant accounts
4. Create applicant dashboard separate from recruiter dashboard
5. Implement applicant-specific features (application tracking, notifications)

**Files to Modify**:

  - **Step 2**: Assessment configuration
- Assessment options:
  1. **No Assessment** - Skip assessment
  2. **Use AI-Generated Questions** (Recommended)
     - Use Gemini to generate MCQs based on job details
     - Highlight benefits: Fast, online, role-specific
  3. **Use Question Bank** - Select from existing question pools
  4. **Custom Questions** - Create your own questions

**Implementation Plan**:

**Files to Create/Modify**:
1. Refactor `frontend/app/jobs/create/page.tsx` into multi-step form
2. Create `frontend/app/jobs/create/step2/page.tsx` or use state management
3. Create `frontend/components/assessment-configurator.tsx`
4. Update `backend/src/routes/jobs.js` to handle assessment data
5. Create `backend/src/services/questionGenerationService.js` for Gemini integration
6. Update `backend/src/services/aiService.js` to generate MCQs

**Gemini Integration**:
```javascript
// Generate questions based on job details
const generateAssessmentQuestions = async (jobData) => {
  const prompt = `
    Generate 10 multiple-choice questions for a ${jobData.title} position.
    
    Job Description: ${jobData.description}
    Required Skills: ${jobData.requiredSkills.join(', ')}
    Experience Level: ${jobData.experienceLevel}
    
    Questions should test:
    - Technical knowledge
    - Problem-solving abilities
    - Role-specific skills
    
    Format as JSON array with: question, options (4), correctAnswer, explanation
  `;
  
  const response = await gemini.generateContent(prompt);
