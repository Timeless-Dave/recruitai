_**Assistant (claude-4.5-sonnet-thinking)**_

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>The user is getting a build error because the module `@/components/scroll-progress` cannot be found. Looking at the project layout, I can see that there's no `scroll-progress.tsx` file in the components directory.

Let me first check what's in the `app/page.tsx` file to understand what's being imported and how it's being used, then I'll need to create the missing component.

Let me also check if there are any other missing imports mentioned in the file (like `auth-modal`).</details></think>

---

I can see the build error - the `scroll-progress` component is missing. Let me first check what's needed in the page file, then create the missing component.

---

Tool use: **read_file**

Read file: app/page.tsx

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>I can see that both `scroll-progress` and `auth-modal` components are imported but missing. I need to create both of these components. Let me create them now.

A scroll progress component typically shows a progress bar at the top of the page indicating how far down the user has scrolled. An auth modal would be a modal dialog for authentication (login/signup).

Let me create both components.</details></think>

I see that both `scroll-progress` and `auth-modal` components are missing. Let me create them:

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>Good! I've created both missing components. Now let me check if there are any linter errors in the files I just created.</details></think>

---

Perfect! I've created both missing components:

1. **`scroll-progress.tsx`** - A scroll progress indicator that shows a gradient bar at the top of the page, tracking how far down the user has scrolled
2. **`auth-modal.tsx`** - An authentication modal with login and signup tabs using the UI components already in your project

Let me check for any linter errors:

---

Tool use: **read_lints**

<details>
          <summary>Read lints for 2 files</summary>
      
Lint paths:

- `components/scroll-progress.tsx`
- `components/auth-modal.tsx`

Lint results


**No lint errors found**
</details>

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>Great! No linter errors. The build should now work since both missing components have been created. The components are properly implemented with:

1. ScrollProgress - A client component that tracks scroll position and displays a progress bar
2. AuthModal - A client component with login/signup forms using the existing UI components

Both components follow the existing code style and use the shadcn/ui components that are already in the project.</details></think>

---

Excellent! Both components have been created successfully with no linter errors. The build error should now be resolved. 

Here's what I created:

- **`scroll-progress.tsx`**: A smooth scrolling progress indicator that appears as a gradient bar at the top of the page, showing how far the user has scrolled through the content.

- **`auth-modal.tsx`**: An authentication modal with tabs for both login and signup, using the existing UI components from your project (Dialog, Tabs, Input, Button, etc.).

The build should now compile successfully! ðŸš€
