## ‚úÖ Completed Features

### 1. Notifications System (Fully Functional)

#### Backend Implementation
- **Database Schema**: Added `Notification` model to `backend/prisma/schema.prisma`
  - Fields: id, userId, type, title, message, link, isRead, timestamps
  - Indexes on userId, isRead, and createdAt for performance

- **API Routes**: Created `backend/src/routes/notifications.js`
  - `GET /api/notifications` - Fetch user notifications with pagination
  - `POST /api/notifications/:id/read` - Mark single notification as read
  - `POST /api/notifications/read-all` - Mark all notifications as read
  - `DELETE /api/notifications/:id` - Delete single notification
  - `DELETE /api/notifications` - Delete all notifications
  - `POST /api/notifications/create` - Create new notification (internal use)

- **Server Integration**: Updated `backend/src/server.js` to include notification routes

#### Frontend Implementation
- **Notifications Dropdown**: Created `frontend/components/notifications-dropdown.tsx`
  - Real-time notification badge with count
  - Dropdown with scrollable notifications list
  - Mark as read functionality
  - Delete notifications
  - Navigate to notification links
  - Auto-refresh every 30 seconds

- **Sidebar Integration**: Updated `frontend/components/dashboard/dashboard-sidebar.tsx`
  - Added Notifications menu item with badge
  - Shows unread count in sidebar (both expanded and collapsed states)
  - Updates count every 30 seconds

- **Dashboard Header**: Updated `frontend/components/dashboard/dashboard-header.tsx`
  - Replaced static notification button with functional NotificationsDropdown component

- **Notifications Page**: Created `frontend/app/notifications/page.tsx`
  - Full page for viewing all notifications
  - Tabs: All, Unread, Read
  - Mark all as read functionality
  - Individual delete and mark as read actions
  - Responsive design with animations

---

### 2. Profile Dropdown (Already Functional, Verified)

The profile dropdown in the dashboard header already includes:
- User name and email display
- Profile navigation
- Settings navigation
- Functional logout with redirect to home page

---

### 3. Analytics Page Cleanup & Reorganization

#### Changes Made to `frontend/app/analytics/page.tsx`

**Before**: Bulky layout with tabs and multiple sections competing for attention

**After**: Clean, visual-first design prioritizing the recruitment funnel
- **Simplified Metrics**: 4 compact key metrics at the top (Applications, Success Rate, Avg. Time, Conversion)
- **Prominent Funnel Visualization**: Full-width recruitment funnel with:
  - Visual progress bars with animated fill
  - Icon for each stage
  - Clear counts and percentages
  - Hover effects for interactivity
- **Secondary Metrics**: Split into two cards below funnel
  - Top Skills in Demand (left)
  - Quick Insights (right)
- **Removed**: Tabs that created unnecessary complexity
- **Connected to API**: Now fetches real data from `/api/auth/analytics`

#### Backend Analytics Endpoint
Created analytics endpoint in `backend/src/routes/auth.js`:
- `GET /api/auth/analytics`
- Returns: totalApplications, avgProcessingTime, successRate, topSkills
- Calculates real metrics from database
- Properly aggregates data from Score and Applicant models

---

### 4. Jobs Page - "My Jobs" Tab

#### Changes to `frontend/app/jobs/page.tsx`
- Added "My Jobs" tab to the tabs list (All Jobs, **My Jobs**, Active, Drafts, Closed)
- Updated filtering logic to support the new tab
- Currently shows all jobs for "My Jobs" (ready for backend filtering by creator)

---

### 5. Dashboard Functionality with Real API Data

#### Backend Dashboard Endpoint Fixed
Updated `backend/src/routes/auth.js`:
- Fixed `/api/auth/recruiter/dashboard` endpoint
- Corrected data aggregation from Score model (was incorrectly trying to get finalScore from Applicant)
- Now properly fetches:
  - Total jobs count
  - Active jobs count
  - Total applicants count
  - Average score from Score model
  - Recent jobs with applicant counts and average scores
- All calculations use correct Prisma relations

#### Dashboard Components
Both `dashboard-stats.tsx` and `jobs-table.tsx` were already built to consume real API data - they just needed the backend to be properly configured.

## üìù Notes

- The "My Jobs" tab currently shows all jobs. To filter by creator, add a `createdById` field to the Job model and update the backend filtering logic.
- Top Skills in the analytics are currently calculated as percentages of total applications. For production, integrate with CV parsing to extract real skills data.
- Notification creation is set up but needs to be triggered by events (new applicant, status change, etc.) - integrate into relevant backend routes.
